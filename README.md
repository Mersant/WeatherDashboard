# WeatherDashboard
A wonderful little weather web app. Uses the openweather API to search for the current weather in a given city as well as the forecast for the next 5 days. Additionally, today's forecast includes a color coded UV index so the user may gauge what precautions they should take before going outside. The user's search history is saved in localStorage and displayed as clickable items on the left sidebar. This way, the user may easily click on past search terms to quickly bring up the desired city.
